# restaurant
Creating a complete restaurant management system and point of sale is a large project that involves many components. Here's a high-level overview of what such a system might look like in Python. This is a simplified version and for a real-world application, you would need to add more features, error handling, security measures, and possibly a graphical user interface or web interface.

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class Inventory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = []

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products.append(product)

    def get_product(self, name):
        for product in self.products:
            if product.name == name:
                return product
        return None

class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add_item(self, product, quantity):
        self.items.append((product, quantity))

    def total(self):
        return sum(item[0].price * item[1] for item in self.items)

class PointOfSale:
    def __init__(self, inventory):
        self.inventory = inventory
        self.orders = []

    def create_order(self):
        order = Order()
        self.orders.append(order)
        return order

    def checkout(self, order):
        total = order.total()
        # Here you would add payment processing code
        print(f"Total: {total}")
```

You can use these classes to manage your inventory, create orders, and handle checkout. For example:

```python
inventory = Inventory()
inventory.add_product(Product("Burger", 5.99))
inventory.add_product(Product("Fries", 2.99))

pos = PointOfSale(inventory)

order = pos.create_order()
order.add_item(inventory.get_product("Burger"), 2)
order.add_item(inventory.get_product("Fries"), 1)

pos.checkout(order)
```

This code will create an inventory with two products, create an order with two burgers and one fries, and then checkout the order, calculating the total price.

Remember, this is a very basic example. A full restaurant management system would also need to handle things like tax, discounts, multiple payment methods, printing receipts, managing tables, tracking inventory, employee management, and much more. It would also likely need a database to store all this information. You might want to consider using a framework or platform that is designed for building this type of system, or hiring a professional developer if you're not comfortable doing it yourself.
